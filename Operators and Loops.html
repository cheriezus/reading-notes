    <h3>Binary and Unary</h3>
    <p>Binary - operator requires two operands</p>
    <p>Unary - operator requires one operands on either side</p>

    <h3>Operators</h3>
    <p>Assignment - assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.</p>

    <h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
    <p>compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true</p>

    <h3>Loops</h3>
    <p>offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. Various loop mechanisms offer different
         ways to determine the start and end points of the loop.</p>

         <H3>for Statement</H3>
         <p>A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false</p>
         <p>Initial Expression - expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, and can declare variables</p>
           <p>Condition Expression - expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression 
           is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates.</p>
           <p>Statement - statement executes</p>
