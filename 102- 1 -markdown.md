# Lab: 01b - Learning Markdown

Hi! My name is Cheri. Below is my interpretation of the Growth Mindset & 3 reminders on how I can consciously apply it to daily life. Don't stay here too long. Just kidding.

## Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is understanding that the struggle as you're learning is part of the process. Generally optimistic, but practical when it comes to any obstacles. 

### 3 Reminders to Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset

1. When losing focus during a difficult obstacle, do not go into **"instant gratification monkey syndrome."**
2. No pain no gain!
3. When things go wrong, what can I do to make sure it doesn't happen again?
