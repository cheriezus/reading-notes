#Greetings!

My name is Cheri and I'm a Los Angeles Native. That takes up the majority of my personality so I'll be quick. I come from a primarily customer service and office administration background, but have been lucky enough to be paid for some of my budding passions, such as comedy and using photoshop and video editing. I'm excited for this class, because now I will be able to finally create a website, and be able to use what I learn to hopefully destroy SEO marketing and provide free information back to the people.
